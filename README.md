# Personal-Website

## Summary
This is a Codecademy project to showcase the skills that I have learnt in front-end design to create a personal portfolio website which is dynamic, responsive and user accessible.

## Goals
* Build a website using HTML and CSS.
* Add at least one interactive feature using JS.
* Use git version control.
* Use command line and file navigation.
* Develop locally on your computer.

## Description
My portfolio website is split into 5 sections: a nagivation bar, an about me section, a projects section, a skills section and a contact information section. The navigation bar is quite self explanatory contains links to different sections of the page. The about me section contains an image and a short description of me and the courses I have currently completed on Codecademy. This section, when observed on a mobile phone, will have the image disappear for better readability. Followong this section is the projects section and has an interactive button that can be used to scroll through the types of projects I have completed. When observed on a phone the button will dissappear and the projects will be seen as a column list. Proceding this, we have the skills section which lists all the skills I have currently developed with the platform Codecademy, my university degree and my previous work experience. Finally, within the footer I have my contact email.

## Future Adaptions

* Add links on each of project names to the relevant github repositories
* Add new projects as I complete more with the Codecademy platform
* Add a media query for tablet screens
