                    Hi all, I am a engineering graduate from Cambridge. I am learning to code with Codecademy.
                    I have completed many projects with the platform, these projects are from the few courses I 
                    have completed. These courses include: Data Scientist - Machine Learning, Computer Science and
                    Full Stack Engineer.
                    <br><br>
                    A few of my hobbies include: playing and watching football, watching the nfl and playing
                    micro-stakes poker in my spare time. I support Tottenham Hotspur and the Kansas City Chiefs and
                    watch their games whenever I can.
